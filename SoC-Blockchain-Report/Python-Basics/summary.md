 ## INTRODUCTION
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented language created by Guido van Rossum. It supports multiple programming paradigms and is known for its clear syntax. Python powers applications in AI, data analysis, automation, and web development. Its large community and huge collection of libraries make it highly practical for solving real-world problems.

## Syntax
Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line:
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

## Indentation
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

##   Comments
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

### 🧪 Example Code:
```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Paridhi")
```
