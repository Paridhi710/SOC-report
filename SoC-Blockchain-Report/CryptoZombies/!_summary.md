# ðŸ§Ÿ CryptoZombies

CryptoZombies is an interactive platform where we learn to build Ethereum-based DApps using Solidity, the programming language for smart contracts.
we create your own Zombie game by writing smart contracts step-by-step in a fun, gamified format.
The lessons start with basics like creating zombie DNA, naming zombies, and storing them on the blockchain.
we then learn inheritance, modifiers, mappings, structs, and how to interact with users.
The platform introduces Web3.js, showing how to connect smart contracts to a website frontend.
we get hands-on practice deploying smart contracts and calling blockchain functions.

Till now I have completed level 1 and level 2 of solidity track.
