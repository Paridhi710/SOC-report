#  Web3 Tech Stack

## What is Web3?
- Web3 moves beyond Web1 (static websites) and Web2 (interactive platforms) to become the “internet of value.”
- It enables decentralized applications (dApps) where users control their data and identity—no more reliance on companies like Google or Facebook.
- Key advantages include ownership, composability (apps working together), and enhanced trust and reliability. 

## Web3 Architecture Overview
The frontend (e.g. React/Next.js) mirrors Web2, but the backend shifts to:
- Blockchain nodes instead of centralized servers
- Off-chain storage, like IPFS
- Wallets/private-key auth for user identity and security

## Web3 tech stack 

### Blockchain
The base layer where all transactions and smart contracts live. Start with Ethereum and Solidity due to large community and ease of learning.

### Blockchain Node
Like a server, it connects to the blockchain network and shares data. You can run your own or use services like Infura or Quicknode.

### P2P Database
Used for off-chain data (like user profiles) to avoid high blockchain costs. Works like torrents — Ceramic is a popular option.

### Decentralized File Storage
Stores large files (images, videos) in a decentralized way. IPFS and Arweave are common tools for this.

### Authentication
Users log in using wallets (e.g., MetaMask), which prove identity with private keys. Tools like Web3Auth make it simpler for new users.

### Frontend
Built using familiar tools like React or Next.js. The design adjusts to Web3 flows like wallet login and blockchain delays.

### Web3 Libraries & Dev Tools
Libraries like Ethers.js and tools like Hardhat or Remix help your frontend interact with the blockchain and test smart contracts easily.
