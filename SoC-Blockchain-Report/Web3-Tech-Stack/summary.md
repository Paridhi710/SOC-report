#  Web3 Tech Stack

## What is Web3?
Web3 moves beyond Web1 (static websites) and Web2 (interactive platforms) to become the “internet of value.”
It enables decentralized applications (dApps) where users control their data and identity—no more reliance on companies like Google or Facebook.
Key advantages include ownership, composability (apps working together), and enhanced trust and reliability. 

## Web3 Architecture Overview
The frontend (e.g. React/Next.js) mirrors Web2, but the backend shifts to:
Blockchain nodes instead of centralized servers
Off-chain storage, like IPFS
Wallets/private-key auth for user identity and security
